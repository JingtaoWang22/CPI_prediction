# Compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction using GNN and Protein Transformer

The code is the implementation of GNN-PT, a deep learning model for compound protein interaction (CPI) prediction. It uses Graph Neural Network for learning the representation of protein. For learning protein's representation, it adopts Protein Transformer, in order to take the advantage of self-attention and capture the long-distance interaction between amino acid residues.

In this repository, the CPI datasets of human and *C. elegans* are created by Liu et al. in this paper:
"[Improving compoundâ€“protein interaction prediction by building up highly credible negative samples (Bioinformatics, 2015).](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/12/i221/216307)"

In the problem setting of CPI prediction,
an input is the pair of a SMILES format of compound and an amino acid sequence of protein;
an output is a binary label (interact or not).
The SMILES is converted with RDKit and
we obtain a 2D graph-structured data of the compound (i.e., atom types and their adjacency matrix).

Representation of proteins and compounds learned by 2 sub-networks are concatenated to predict the interaction.
